During the development of the Password Generator application, we faced a few challenges. One of the main challenges was implementing the logic to generate random passwords based on the user's selected criteria. We had to ensure that the generated passwords met the specified requirements, such as including special characters and having a certain length.


Another challenge was creating a responsive user interface that would adapt to different screen sizes. We had to carefully design and style the application to ensure that it looked good and was easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.


Overall, these challenges helped us improve our problem-solving and coding skills. We were able to overcome them by researching and experimenting with different approaches until we found the best solutions.


We hope you find the Password Generator application useful and enjoy using it to generate secure passwords for your online accounts!
